        <li>Each day, you’ll be guided to study a specific subtopic and complete a scientifically backed number of practice problems to build mastery.</li>
        <li>The question generator adapts to your progress, providing fresh questions for each concept so you never run out of practice.</li>
        <li>All materials are unique to this course and cannot be found anywhere else.</li>
