      <h2>About the Tutor</h2>
      <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Sanmay Pachika</strong>. I specialize in making SAT Math simple and repeatable through pattern recognition and smart heuristics. I work at Georgia Tech and scored in the <strong>99th percentile</strong> on the SAT Math section. I have completed college‑level math and computer science coursework while still in high school and have mentored peers in STEM clubs and math problem‑solving.</p>

            <h3>Beginner Course</h3>
            <p>An asynchronous, self‑paced program delivered via our Slack workspace. Each day we post new lesson material and practice sets for a specific subtopic. You decide when to study, work through the lessons at your own pace, and complete the assigned practice. All assignments are graded automatically and progress is tracked, but there is no direct instructor feedback. All material is unique to this course—you won’t find it anywhere else.</p>

            <h3>Medium Course</h3>
            <p>Classes are taught in a classroom style four times per week (2&nbsp;hours each) over a three‑month schedule, replicating the experience of an in‑person classroom of around 30 students. The course runs just like a classroom: announcements are posted on Slack, homework is assigned and checked regularly, and practice tests are administered and reviewed. All material is original to this program. By the end of the course you’ll have completed over 3,000 problems, recognized recurring patterns in SAT Math, and will know exactly what to do when you see them.</p>

            <h3>Intensive Course</h3>
            <p>One‑on‑one coaching with flexible scheduling—up to four sessions per week over a three‑month period leading up to your SAT. Lessons are rigorous, with homework and practice customized for you. You’ll receive constant feedback, tips and tricks, and advanced strategies to master every question type. Because it’s one‑on‑one, you’ll be closely watched so you get all the help and materials you need. By the end of the course you will have worked through over 3,000 problems, recognized patterns, and developed a repeatable approach for every topic.</p>

      <h2>Curriculum Overview</h2>
      <p>The Digital SAT Math section is divided into two modules and focuses on the areas of math that play the biggest role in college and career success. You will master:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Algebra:</strong> Linear equations, inequalities, and functions.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Math:</strong> Nonlinear expressions, quadratic and exponential functions, rational functions, and manipulating expressions.</li>
        <li><strong>Problem Solving &amp; Data Analysis:</strong> Ratios, rates, percentages, descriptive statistics, and analyzing tables and graphs.</li>
        <li><strong>Geometry &amp; Trigonometry:</strong> Lines, angles, circles, triangles, area/volume, right triangle trigonometry, and radian measure.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Approximately 13–15 questions test Algebra and Advanced Math, and 5–7 questions each test Problem Solving &amp; Data Analysis and Geometry &amp; Trigonometry.</p>

      <h2>Why Our Program Stands Out</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personalized Instruction:</strong> We replicate a classroom environment with around 30 students in the Medium Course and offer one‑on‑one sessions in the Intensive Course, whereas national test prep companies often place dozens of students in a single class without personalized guidance.</li>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive Practice:</strong> Our course includes interactive lessons, multiple‑choice questions, and detailed explanations. Many competitors rely on canned video lectures with limited practice.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive Pricing:</strong> Major companies charge around $799–$949 for live online courses of 18–36 hours. Our Medium Course is just $599 and includes more sessions per week plus unlimited practice, and our Beginner Course is only $199 for full digital access.</li>
        <li><strong>Expert Tutor:</strong> You’ll learn from Sanmay, who works at Georgia Tech and scored in the 99th percentile on the SAT Math section.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible Curriculum:</strong> Students can choose topics and difficulty levels to target their weaknesses, while large classes follow a rigid syllabus.</li>
      </ul>
